    <outline text="Skeptoid is a weekly science podcast dedicated to furthering knowledge by
blasting away the widespread pseudosciences that infect popular culture, and
replacing them with way cooler reality. Each weekly episode focuses on a
single phenomenon — an urban legend, a paranormal claim, alternative therapy,
or something just plain stupid — that you've heard of, and that you probably
believe in. Skeptoid attempts to expose the folly of belief in non-evidence
based phenomena, and more importantly, explains the factual scientific
reality. From the sublime to the startling, no topic is sacred, politically
incorrect though that may be." title="Skeptoid" type="rss" xmlUrl="http://skeptoid.com/podcast.xml"/>
